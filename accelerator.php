            The Accelerator program will take place 2 or 3 times a week for a period of 2 months.
            The actual date and times are flexible according to the participants that are selected.

        <h3><img src="assets/icons/screen.png" class='rules_image' alt="Sharks" /> Welcome to the Shark Tank</h3>
        <p>
            Shark Tank is a popular TV show on ABC that airs on Friday nights. It allows
            entrepreneurs to make a pitch to a panel of 5 million and billionaires to invest in
            their company or product. That is what we're going to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have a great idea of a business, put it down on paper and fill out our application.
            We will be accepting applications until the end of May. We will then contact those who made
            the cut to give a presentation to the Sycamore Leaf management team. Based on your presentation,
            you may be asked to be a part of the Accelerator and have a great life experience. 
        </p>
        
        <h3><img src="assets/icons/power-cord.png" class='rules_image' alt="Motivation" /> Motivation is a must</h3>
        <p>
            Being an entrepreneur is all about being motivated. No one is going to poke and prod
            you to get up in the morning and get to work. It's all about your ability to light a
            fire under your own butt and do work. During this program, you'll have a TON of
            resources at your disposal: marketing experts, business leaders, technical wizards, etc.
            But they aren't going to do anything for you. They will be there to help, guide and mentor you
            to your own success.
        </p>
        
        <h3><img src="assets/icons/dice.png" class='rules_image' alt="Possibilities" /> Endless possibilities.</h3>
        <p>
            Just beause this is the "Summer Tech Series" doesn't mean that your potential business
            has to be technology related. If you have an idea for a product or service, we'll
            definitely be able to help make your vision a reality. However, these days every business
            needs to harness the power of technology in some way, so be prepared to get agile!

                I have a great idea for a business but there is already a service/product

                    Part of being a successful business is sharing your story with your potential
                    customers. When you look at all the competitors in your market, you will learn
                    to accept that there are a lot of similarities and focus on what makes you different.

                <a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion2" href="#collapseTwo">
                I have a million dollar idea but I'm lazy. Can I just sell it to you?
                </a>

            <div id="collapseTwo" class="accordion-body collapse in">

                    <p>
                    No, you may not. Million dollar ideas are a dime a dozen. In fact, I thought
                    of 4 of them while in the shower this morning. What <strong>REALLY</strong>
                    matters is the execution of those ideas. And to execute properly, you can't be
                    lazy. Have a great summer! *waves*

                    Don't let that keep you from applying. We can always look past the stutters
                    and excessive sweat. If you've got a good head on your shoulders, a good idea
                    and the work ethic to succeed, you're golden.

                    Not at all. Throughout this experience, you will be taught how to develop your product
                    or service, do market research, generate a sales and/or pricing structure and market
                    effectively to your target audience. No experience required. Just a good idea and a strong
                    work ethic.
