    <h2> Accelerator </h2>

        <div class="container-narrow">

        <h3><img src="assets/icons/briefcase.png" class='rules_image' alt="Work" /> Do work!</h3>
        <p>
            The Accelerator program will take place 2 or 3 times a week for a period of 2 months.
            The actual date and times are flexible according to the participants that are selected.
        </p>
        
        <h3><img src="assets/icons/screen.png" class='rules_image' alt="Sharks" /> Welcome to the Shark Tank</h3>
        <p>
            Shark Tank is a popular TV show on ABC that airs on Friday nights. It allows
            entreprenuers to make a pitch to a panel of 5 million and billionaires to invest in
            their company or product. That is what we're going to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have a great idea of a business, put it down on paper and fill out our application.
            We will be accepting applications until the end of May. We will then contact those who made
            the cut to give a presentation to the Sycamore Leaf management team. Based on your presentation,
            you may be asked to be apart of the Accelerator and have a great life experience. 
        </p>
        
        <h3><img src="assets/icons/power-cord.png" class='rules_image' alt="Motivation" /> Motivation is a must</h3>
        <p>
            Being an entreprenuer is all about being motivated. No one is going to poke and prod
            you to get up in the morning and get to work. It's all about your ability to light a
            fire under your own butt and do work. During this program, you'll have a TON of
            resources at your disposal: marketing experts, business leaders, technical wizards, etc.
            But they aren't going to do anything for you. They will be there to help, guide and mentor you
            to your own success.
        </p>
        
        <h3><img src="assets/icons/dice.png" class='rules_image' alt="Possibilities" /> Endless possibilities.</h3>
        <p>
            Just beause this is the "Summer Tech Series" doesn't mean that your potential business
            has to be technology related. If you have an idea for a product or service, we'll
            definitely be able to help make your vision a reality. However, these days every business
            needs to harness the power of technology in some way, so be prepared to get agile!

    <h2> Dev Bootcamp </h2>
    
        <div class="container-narrow">

        <h3><img src="assets/icons/calendar.png" class='rules_image' alt="When" /> Summer time is busy.</h3>
        <p>
            We know this. That is why we're attempting to make participating in this bootcamp
            as easy as possible. The Development Bootcamp will run the week of July 13th.
            We will offer two period of instruction each day; 9:00AM to 12:00PM
            as well as 2:00PM to 5:00PM. We hope that offering two different time slots will help
            those who have a busy schedule join in the fun.
        </p>
        
        <h3><img src="assets/icons/shocked.png" class='rules_image' alt="Babysitting" /> We aren't a babysitting service...</h3>
        <p>
            This bootcamp is going to be intense. If you <em>really</em> don't want to be here,
            it will be a struggle. 
            We're going to be covering a lot of connect very quickly and we expect you to be engaged
            and active while you're present.
        </p>
        
        <h3><img src="assets/icons/cool.png" class='rules_image' alt="Fun" /> but we will have fun.</h3>
        <p>
            That last bullet point was a bit harsh. Please know that it is our desire to make
            learning how to code fun and exciting. The instruction time will include 'lectures',
            group projects and competitions- just to keep everyone on their toes.
        </p>
        
        <h3><img src="assets/icons/target.png" class='rules_image' alt="Aim" /> Our aim is to be passionate.</h3>
        <p>
            Make no mistake about it- when you complete the bootcamp you will be well versed and
            familiar with many crucial programming concepts. However, one of the amazing things about
            coding is that there is often multiple ways to solve the main problem. We're going to aim
            to educate you about the essentials in the easiest way possible. We may not be perfect,
            but we're passionate.
        </p>

        <p>
            Only <strong>YOU</strong> can decide what you will learn, but the material that we will
            talk about will cover the basic building blocks of the web.
            <br />
            The topics that will be covered, even if ever so briefly:
            <ul>
                <li>HTML - the structure of the web</li>
                <li>CSS - making things stylish</li>
                <li>JavaScript - giving your site some attitude</li>
                <li>L.A.M.P. - and not the kind that needs a lightbulb</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            Everyone that wants to participate in the hackathon will meet at the Sycamore Leaf Solutions
            headquarters (321 E. Military Ave) at 6pm on Friday evening. Please park in the back or use
            the overflow parking lot on Main and Broad (across from Runza) if the parking lot is full.

        <p>
            "Idea Men" - the guys who have the ideas for the projects will each get 5 minutes to explain
            their vision and try to get coders to work with them. They will have access to a projector and
            laptop if they want to show some sketches or examples. 
        </p>
        
        <h3><img src="assets/icons/link.png" class='rules_image' alt="The Grouping" /> The Grouping</h3>
        <p>
            After all the ideas have been heard, teams will form up around the ideas. Each team
            will come up with a team name and be assigned a Git repo to keep their code. There
            is no limit to minimum amount of people on a team. If you're the only person who wants
            to work on an idea, if you think you can get it done, more power to you! There must be,
            however, <em>at least</em> two teams for any prizes to be awarded.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next 48 hours will be a blur of typing, pizza eating and Redbull drinking. Your
            projects can be written in any coding language you wish to use (make sure your whole
            team is on the same page...) We will encourage small cat-naps, restroom breaks
            and trips for fresh air.
            <br />
            No production ready materials will be allowed. Do not work on any images, code snippets,
            or logic beforehand. Using assets that have been worked on ahead of time is grounds for
            disqualification. Please commit to your repo early and often as they will be monitored
            throughout the two days event.
            <br />
            All the code that is produced during the event is owned by the originator. We're not
            here to steal your ideas. We just want the ideas to come to fruition and to have fun.

        <h3><img src="assets/icons/trophy.png" class='rules_image' alt="The Judging" /> The Judging</h3>
        <p>
            At 6pm on Sunday night each team will have an opportunity to present their project. You
            can use this time to demonstrate what it does, describe who would use it and how you would
            market it to them, as well as explain the revenue model if there is one.
            <br />
            The judges will be looking at the following criteria when picking a winner:

                <li>Completeness</li>
