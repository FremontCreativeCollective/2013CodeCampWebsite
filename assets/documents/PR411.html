<h3>Sycamore Leaf Solutions Hosts Summer Tech Series in Fremont, NE</h3>
<h4>Three Technology and Entrepreneurship Events Slated for July</h4>

<p>Fremont, NE – April 11, 2013 – Sycamore Leaf Solutions wants to get people
in Fremont excited about technology. They plan on doing so by making history
and sponsoring the city of Fremont’s first-ever hackathon. What is a hackathon?
It’s an event that brings people together in an intensely collaborative and
sometimes competitive environment to work on computer software projects.
The end result might be enhancing an existing technology, integrating
technologies, or creating something entirely new.</p>

<p>Menlo Park, CA, a city roughly the same size as Fremont, has become famous
for hosting hackathons; many new products, and even new companies, have
resulted directly from these events.  Menlo Park is also the site of Facebook’s
corporate headquarters, and that has certainly played a large role in the
success of their events. </p>

<p>The Hackathon is just one event in a three-event series slated to take place
this summer dubbed the “Summer Tech Series”. These events all have the end goal
of promoting a spirit of entrepreneurship and a love of technology in the youth
of Fremont and the surrounding areas. </p>

<p>The people behind Sycamore Leaf Solutions hope to create a similar level of
success for technology events in Fremont as that of Menlo Park.  “We hope to
attract a diverse crowd of people for this inaugural Summer Tech Series,” said
Event Director Brock Ellis, “and we are offering three different events which
will cater to any tech-minded individuals, regardless of their skill
levels.” </p>

<p>The first event of the Summer Tech series is the Accelerator Program, and
it’s designed to help galvanize high-school or college-aged students, and young
adults, who are interested in someday starting their own business.
The Accelerator program will take participants through the process of becoming
an entrepreneur, including developing a business plan, creating a product, and
implementing a marketing strategy. </p>

<p>The second event is called Dev Bootcamp.  As the name implies, it’s an
intense five-day bootcamp designed to instill the basics of computer
programming.  Dev Bootcamp is aimed at young people who might be considering a
career in programming, or for more mature people looking for a career
change.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the Hackathon, a fun-filled 48-hour event which will team
up business and tech-minded individuals with the goal of creating a technology
product, service, or enhancement from scratch. This event is a great
opportunity for anyone who is interested in technology to learn more about
their particular passion, connect with like-minded individuals, and possibly
start a new business, or launch a new product. </p>

<p>Ellis, who is also a computer programmer at Sycamore Leaf Solutions, has
high hopes that Fremont might someday evolve into the Silicon Valley of the
Midwest.  “In the grand scheme, it’s not just about hosting successful
technology events, it’s about elevating the technological culture in Fremont;
it’s about creating tech jobs, and attracting qualified people to live in
Fremont.”</p>

<p>The Summer Tech Series runs July 8th – 14th. For more information or to

<p>This event is sponsored by Sycamore Leaf Solutions, LLC,
Midland University, and First State Bank.</p>
